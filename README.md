## Purpose
This repository was created as an example of reusable workflows in GitHub Actions that allow for multiple operating system status badges. The approach can easily be adapted for, say, multiple versions of compilers. I created this repository to link to somebody that had a question on the matter. Anybody can link to this repository, and use, or adapt, the code from this repository.
